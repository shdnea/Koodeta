=== Overview ===

The Attribute Delete Plus tool is an enhanced version of the standard Attribute 
Delete node, designed to provide additional functionality for more flexible and 
efficient attribute management. This tool expands on the original node by 
integrating Group Delete and Attribute Cast features directly into its 
parameters, allowing users to manage both attributes and groups 
within a single node.
