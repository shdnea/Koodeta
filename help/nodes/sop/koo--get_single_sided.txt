""" Isolate double sided mesh into single sided mesh. 
Useful for Vellum Simulation. """

=== Overview ===
The Get One Sided tool is a specialized tool designed to convert 
double-sided meshes into single-sided meshes. This process is essential 
for optimizing geometry for simulations, particularly in workflows like 
Vellum where single-sided meshes improve accuracy and performance.

WARNING:
    This tool may not work effectively for all types of meshes. For highly 
    complex input geometry, the resulting single-sided mesh may vary and may 
    not always produce the desired output. It is recommended to review and 
    validate the results, especially for intricate or non-manifold geometry.


=== How to use ===
* Wire the double sided geometry to the first input.
* Use the Front Primitive Selection parameter to specify the front-facing 
primitive on your input geometry.
* Fine-tune the Angle Sensitivity parameter to achieve the desired result.
  
  WARNING:
    The Threshold value is highly sensitive, avoid setting values above 
    1 to maintain accuracy.

@inputs

Double Sided Mesh:
    Double sided geometry.
    
@parameters

== General ==

Front Primitive:
    Specifies the front-facing primitive.
Threshold:
    Determines the threshold for removing back-facing primitives.
     Higher values may result in more aggressive removal.
