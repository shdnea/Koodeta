# Each entry starts with no indentation and gives the key used
# by the menu callback.  By convention, this is nodename/parmname.
# Multiple keys can be given for the same entry.
#
# The next line gives the name of the expression.  Its indentation
# level is then used for the remainder of the text.  All the
# code until the next parameter are appended together to make
# the snippet.  All preceeding indentation is removed.
# Note that tabs == 8 is assumed.
